# What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?

What I find most interesting about this article is the low cost of DeepSeek's AI development, especially when compared to the massive investments being made by companies like OpenAI and Google. DeepSeek has managed to create a high-performing AI app for only $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions being poured into AI by U.S. companies. This raises questions about the sustainability of AI investments and whether other companies are overvaluing their tech. DeepSeek's ability to do more with less could be a game-changer in the AI landscape, and it's success is shaking up the market.
